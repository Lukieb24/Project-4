# Project-4
Project 4 for triple ten data science
# Random Event Simulation Tool

As we look at this data, we can begin by cloning the repository to our local machines using git clone <repository-url>. From there, we'll navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt. Once everything is set up, we can launch the Streamlit app by executing streamlit run <filename>.py in the terminal. This will open up the vehicle dataset analysis dashboard in our browsers, allowing us to explore trends in vehicle prices, mileage, and other key factors. It's a simple, interactive way to engage with the data and extract valuable insights.
